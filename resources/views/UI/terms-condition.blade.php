        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Dear Customers, Tech Help Info always places the highest importance on customers.
            Nevertheless, in order to improve customer service quality, timeliness and speed,
            some rules and regulations have to be followed. Special request to the esteemed customers to follow the following
            rules well before buying computer products from Tech help Info Thanks.<br><br>
            The warranties on the products declared at the time of sale are basically warranties
            issued by the manufacturer. This means that the warranty service of the product sold is
            mainly carried by the parent company of the specific brand. Each brand is independent in terms
            of warranty service variation and their different terms are mentioned on their own official website.
            In this case, the subsidiary Star Tech is working as
            a means to enforce the warranty terms of service of the original brand companies.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <b>The warranty terms set by the manufacturer are as follows:</b>
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> We follow the warranty policy of each product given by International, Domestic and Bangladesh Computer Society (BCS).
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> Tech Help Info The warranty of most of the products imported by the company
            is short-lived and some of the products are replaced as soon as the complaint is received.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> Warranty is not provided on all the products sold. The warranty is valid only for those products for
            which the parent company has declared a warranty period.
        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> Depending on the brand and model of the laptop, the warranty is 1-3 years. But the warranty of all
            laptop batteries and adapters is only 1 year
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> If there is no need to change the product of a particular model, Tech Help Info can replace its current stock with the equivalent product of any other brand.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> If the product of a particular model is non-repairable and the same or equivalent product is not available in our stock, then a better product from that model can be replaced by depreciation and price adjustment.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> Tech Help Info will not be responsible if any software or data is damaged or lost during the use of the product or during the service of Tech Help Info. Note that in this case, the responsibility of data recovery or software restoration work will not be on Tech Help Info.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> There is no fixed time to return the product after completing the service work after taking the product of the specific model under warranty, this time can be from 5-7 days to a maximum of 35-40 days or more; This is because in most cases, the parts required for repair do not have sufficient buffer
            stock in the country, so they have to be imported, which is very time consuming.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> Consumers are informed that most of the warranty products are not repaired, the parts that are damaged are replaced but in most cases are imported from abroad.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> The computer setup and operating system that is customized at the time of sale is not covered by the warranty.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> Lifetime Warranty Basically you will get the warranty facility as long as the product is present in the market.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> Star Tech will be able to set the price for any service outside the scope of the warranty which will be effective subject to the consent of the buyer.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            >> In case of service warranty, if any part needs to be changed or added, the buyer will usually collect it at his own risk or with the consent of the buyer,
            you can collect it through Tech Help Info subject to advance payment.
